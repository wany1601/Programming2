## Task 1

### Requirement

Use inheritance and polymorphism to solve a real-world system development problem.

1. Pretend that there is a business in the real world and the owner asks you to design a system for it, examples like: a Library, a Restaurant, a Zoo, a SportTeam, a GroceryStore, etc.

2. Your project must contain:
    * a **3-layer hierarchy of Classes** that satisfy the owner's requirement. Each class in the first and second layer needs at least 2 subclasses. Each class in the hierarchy should have:
        * Default constructor
        * Constructor with data members as parameters
        * Copy constructor
        * The method you designed in the Class Diagram (if applicable)
        * equals
        * toString
        * getters and setters
        
    * You have to add **at least 3 specific methods** in the hierarchy (each layer needs at least 1)
    
* a **XxxxSystem** (or Library, Restaurant, Zoo, etc.) class that contains at least one collection of something that is designed in the previous hierarchy (like a Zoo Library contains books, a Restaurant contains Dishes, a Zoo contains Animals etc.)
    
    * **at least one user defined interface** that is implemented by some of the classes in the hierarchy. The header of methods in the interface must be reasonable. However, the override method body could be simplified if you do not have enough knowledge to code it.
    
3. Draw a UML Class Diagram of the entire project. (Create a screenshot of it and save it as a .png file or a .jpg file)

4. Translate the UML Class Diagram into Java code. Your code should follow the same structure as defined in the UML. (For some of the methods, to implement the real body could be very difficult, then you can just implement a simplified version of it.)
