# 1.3 ArrayList

## 1. Another look at Array

`Array` is a collection of data, with fixed size. Due to the fact that we cannot change its size, it is good to be used in certain situations when the size of the data should be fixed, for example frames of a video, a go game gameboard, or sudoku games. But in a situation that you should change the size of the collection frequently, array is not the best choice, cause every time you want to add a new data, you have to create a new piece of memory to store the data, then copy everything you have, to the new memory, then add the new data in the end. The same when you want to delete some data. 

Why arrays behaves like this is because elements are **continuously** stored in an array, and it brings both pro and con at the same time. 

* **Pro**: Since the elements are continuously stored in an array, it would be **easy to calculate the address of each element**. For example: for array `int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};` , assume the address of the array is `aa`, then the address of the first element is also `aa`, and because it is an `int` array, each element would take 4 bytes space, so the address of the second element is `aa + 4`, and the address of the third element is `aa + 8`, the address of element at index `n` (if exists) would be `aa + 4 * n`. In this case, **since we can easily calculate the address of an element, it would be really quick to read and modify it**.  
* **Con** To keep all elements next to each other in the memory is not easy, especially when we want to add or remove an element. Same example:  `int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};`, there are 3 elements in the array, if we want to add a new element to it, we have to create a new array with length of 4, then copy the 3 elements to it, then we can add the new element in the end. And if we want to remove the element `2`, we have to create a new array with length of 2, then copy the element `1` to it, and then copy the element `3` to it. This creating new array and copying will take a lot of time, especially when you want to add or remove many elements.  



## 2. What is ArrayList

`ArrayList` is very similar to `Array`, **elements inside are also continuously stored. Thus it has the same pro and con as array (good at reading  and writing an element, bad at adding or removing an element)**. However, `ArrayList` belongs to a bigger "family" `List`, which contains many pre-exists methods that we can directly use, for example methods to add a new element and methods to remove an existed element. Most importantly, those methods are optimized, so **ArrayList is much easier to use for adding or removing elements comparing with array**.

### 2.1  Concept of capacity 

Each ArrayList has an attribute `capacity` to indicate how many elements it can hold. Notice: `capacity` does not indicates the number of elements an ArrayList has. You can understand ArrayList as a bag with a specific volume, for example you can put 10 books inside at most. It does not mean there are 10 books in the bag already, there can be 1 book or 8 books or no books inside, and that won't affect the capacity of the bag.  

An array can also be understood as a bag too, however, the bag is always full, if the capacity is 10, then it will be automatically filled by 10 elements, so you may feel the capacity and the number of elements are the same. However, the ArrayList can have some empty space, so the capacity and the number of elements are not necessary the same. Only when the ArrayList is full, then the capacity equals the number of elements.

### 2.2 Why ArrayList is better than Array for inserting

If the number of elements is not equal to the capacity of an array, it means there are some free but "reserved" space in the ArrayList. You can directly add a new element into the reserved place without creating a new ArrayList. For example, if the capacity of an ArrayList is 10, but it only contains 2 elements, then you can add 8 elements to it without creating a new ArrayList. This will save many times since there is no memory allocating and copying. Only when the capacity is full, like there are 10 elements in the ArrayList so there is no more free space in the ArrayList, then if you want to add a new element, Java will create a new ArrayList, **with the capacity twice as big as the original one** (that would be 20 if the capacity of the original one is 10), and then copy the original 10 elements into the new ArrayList. In this case, there will be 10 free spaces for later use. When the new ArrayList with capacity of 20 is full again, Java will create a new ArrayList of capacity of 40 and copy the original 20 elements into it so it has another 20 free space to use.  

## 3 Creating an ArrayList

ArrayList is pre-defined class in Java, so if you want to create an ArrayList, you can directly use its constructor

```java
// not suggested, has no data type restriction
ArrayList al1 = new ArrayList();            // array list of Objects
al1.add(1);                                 // elements can be anything
al1.add(1.1);
al1.add("hello");

// suggested, with data type restriction in <>, you can only put a class in the <>
// you can add Integer to both <> before and after the '=',
// or you can just add it before the '=' if you have two <>
// when you want to create an empty ArrayList, use new constructor
ArrayList<Integer> al2 = new ArrayList<>();          // capacity = 10, but no elements inside
ArrayList<Integer> al3 = new ArrayList<>(100);       // capacity = 100, but no elements inside

// -----------------------------------------------------------
// advanced, will talk about it later in chapeter 2
// -----------------------------------------------------------

// the reference can also be List instead of ArrayList
List<Integer> l4 = new ArrayList();				   // ArrayList is a special kind of array

// when you have specific values you want to put in the ArrayList,
// first create an array with {} to list all elements,
// then use Arrays.asList() to cast the array into a List
Integer[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1};     // array
List<Integer> l5 = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(nums));     
```

 

## 4 Methods

### 4.1 ArrayList methods:

ArrayList methods is a pre-existed class with many useful methods inside:

```java
// Assume we have an ArrayList with 1, 2, 3 inside 
Integer[] nums = {1, 2, 3};     
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(nums));     
```

## 5 ArrayList VS LinkedList (Optional)

`LinkedList` also belongs to the "family" `List`, and that is to say, whatever methods that ArrayList contains also exist for LinkedList.

ArrayList and LinkedList may look very similar, you can actually replace one with the other. However, the two are actually different for memory allocation. 

* ArrayList: elements are `continuously` stored, so it is `good at read and modify each element`, but `bad at adding or removing elements`.

* LinkedList: elements are `not continuously` stored, so it is `bad at read and modify each element`, but `good at adding or removing elements`.
