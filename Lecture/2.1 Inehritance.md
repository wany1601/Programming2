# 2.1 Inheritance

## 1. What is inheritance

`Inheritance` is an OOP feature that helps you to keep you code DRY and easy to maintain. 

Key definition: **For two classes A and B, if A is a special kind of B**, then we say **A inherits from B**. In this case, B is called the **superclass** or (parent), A is called the **subclass** or (child). When you create class A, add `extends B` in the header of the class.

Examples:

 * `Cat` is a special kind of `Animal`: `Cat` is the subclass, `Animal` is the superclass
 * `Basketball` is a special kind of `Ball`: `Basketball` is the subclass, `Ball` is the superclass

```java
public class Cat extends Animal {		// Cat is a special kind of Animal
}
```

 

Notice: **X contains Y is not inheritance**, you should create collection of Y as a data member in X 

```java
public class Library {
    private ArrayList<Book> books;		// Library contains Book 
}
```



Inheritance can be a **chain**, for example: `Cat` is a special kind of `DomesticatedAnimal`, and `DomesticatedAnimalis` a special kind of `Animal`. The sub-subclass also inheritances from the super-super class. (`Cat` also inheritances from `Animal`)

```java
public class DomesticatedAnimal extends Animal{		// DomesticatedAnimal is a special kind of Animal
}

public class Cat extends DomesticatedAnimal{		// Cat is a special kind of DomesticatedAnimal
}
```

When there is inheritance between classes, the relationship between them looks like a family tree, sometimes you may hear people use the term "family" like in the previous example, `Animal`, `DomesticatedAnimal` and `Cat` are in a "family". The real technical term for this is `hierarchy`. So we say `Animal`, `DomesticatedAnimal` and `Cat` are in a `hierarchy`.

## 2. What inheritance can bring us

When you have two classes A and B, A (subclass) inherits from B (superclass), B (superclass) will give everything it has to A, without noticing A. 

For example if you have a superclass `Animal` that contains data members `name` and `age`, then its subclass `Dog` will also have it.

```java
// Animal Class with 2 data members and 4 methods
public class Animal {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

```java
// Dog class extends from Animal class, so it will get all data members and methods from it
// There are 1 data member and 2 methods defined in this class, but it also gets the 2 data members and 4 methods from the super classs, so totally there are 3 data members and 6 methods in the Dog class.
public class Dog extends Animal {
	private int sportHour;
    
	public int getSportHour() {
        return sportHour;
	}

	public void setSportHour(int sportHour) {
        this.sportHour = sportHour;
	}
}
```

If you only have two classes (one superclass and one subclass), then this seems pointless. However, if you have one superclass with many subclasses, the benefit will be much clear. Let's say you have a super class `Animal`, with 5 subclasses: `Dog`, `Cat`, `Monkey`, `Tiger and` `Duck`, if you don't use inheritance, you will have to create data member `name` and `age` for each of them, also the getters and setters, your code will be WET and difficult to maintain. **Inheritance allows you to defined the shared data members and methods in a super class so you only have to define them once.**



## 3. An example of inheritance

When you have to code a hierarchy with many classes, **always follow a top-down order**, which means starting with the super class, then subclasses, then sub-subclasses... 

### 3.1 Define the super class

There is no difference between defining the top super class and a normal class before we learn inheritance. You just need to define it in the old way that we usually do. Except the `equals()` method, which will be explained in `3.2.2`.

### 3.2 Defining a subclass

When you define a subclass, first you should remember, there are some data members and methods defined in the superclass are given to it. 

#### 3.2.1 Defining constructors

In a subclass, data members may partly defined in its superclass, and partly defined in the subclass itself. Constructors should initialize all data members, not only the ones defined in the subclass. 

However, you don't want to make your code WET, the super class has constructors that can be used to initialize the data members defined in the superclass, there is no need to re-invent them again. In this case, you may need to call the constructors in the super class. And remember, **calling the constructor in the super class can only be in the first row in the subclass constructor**. To do so, use the keyword `super` to represent the super class. For example: in `Dog` class (extends `Animal`), `super()` represents the `Animal` class default constructor `Animal()`.

```java
/**
 * Animal Class with 3 constructors
 */
public class Animal {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
	public Animal() {
        this.name = "";
        this.age = -1;
    }

    public Animal(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public Animal(Animal animal) {
        this.name = animal.name;
        this.age = animal.age;
    }
}
```

```java
/**
 * Dog class with 1 additional data member
 */
public class Dog extends DomesticatedAnimal {

    private int sportHour;

    public Dog() {
        super();			// calling the default constructor in the Animal class
        this.sportHour = 0;
    }

    public Dog(int sportHour, String name, int age) {
        super(name, age);	// calling the second constructor in the Animal class
        this.sportHour = sportHour;
    }

    public Dog(Dog dog) {
        super(dog);			// calling the copy constructor in the Animal class
        this.sportHour = dog.sportHour;
    }

}
```

### 3.2.2 Defining equals()

There are two different ways to write the equals() , the `overload` one and the `override` one. In Programming 1 and the very beginning of Programming 2 we use the overload one, which is an equals method to compare with the object of the same class, for example a clock compares with another clock, a student compares with another student, in this case, the parameter of the `equals()` is the same as the class. The override version takes `Object object` as the parameter, no matter what class it is.

// TODO:  

```java
public boolean equals(Animal animal) {
    return this.age == animal.age && 
            this.name.equals(animal.name) && 
            this.type.equals(animal.type) && 
            this.gender.equals(animal.gender);
}
```



```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    // part 1
    if (this == obj)
        return true;
    if (obj == null)
        return false;
    if (getClass() != obj.getClass())
        return false;

    // part 2
    final Animal other = (Animal) obj;

    // part 3
    if (this.age != other.age)
        return false;
    if (!Objects.equals(this.name, other.name))
        return false;
    if (!Objects.equals(this.type, other.type))
        return false;
    if (!Objects.equals(this.gender, other.gender))
        return false;
    return true;
}

```



### 3.2.3 Defining toString()

Same as the constructors, the subclass usually has to use the superclass `toString()` in its own `toString()` method. The syntax to call a `toString()` method of the superclass from the subclass is `super.toString()`

```java
/**
 * superclass toString method, takes care of 4 data members defined in the super class
 */
@Override
public String toString() {
    String str = "";

    str += String.format("%-10s: %s\n", "Name", name);
    str += String.format("%-10s: %s\n", "Type", type);
    str += String.format("%-10s: %d\n", "Age", age);
    str += String.format("%-10s: %s\n", "Gender", gender);

    return str;
}
```

```java
/**
 * subclass toString method, call the super.toString() method to handle the first 4 data members, and only use one * additional String.format() to handle the additional data member.
 */
@Override
public String toString() {
    String str = "";

    str += super.toString();		// calling the superclass toString() method
    str += String.format("%-10s: %d\n", "CloseLevel", closeToHumanLevel);

    return str;
}
```



## 4. Object class

In Java there is a special class names `Object`, technically, every class extends from `Object`. The object class contains some basic methods, such as `toString()`, `equals()`, so whatever class extends from it will automatically have these methods.
