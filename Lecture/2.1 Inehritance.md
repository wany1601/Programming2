# 2.1 Inheritance

## 1. What is inheritance

`Inheritance` is an OOP feature that helps you to keep you code DRY and easy to maintain. 

Key definition: **For two classes A and B, if A is a special kind of B**, then we say **A inherits from B**. In this case, B is called the **superclass** or (parent), A is called the **subclass** or (child). When you create class A, add `extends B` in the header of the class.

Examples:

 * `Cat` is a special kind of `Animal`: `Cat` is the subclass, `Animal` is the superclass
 * `Basketball` is a special kind of `Ball`: `Basketball` is the subclass, `Ball` is the superclass

```java
public class Cat extends Animal {		// Cat is a special kind of Animal
}
```

 

Notice: **X contains Y is not inheritance**, you should create collection of Y as a data member in X 

```java
public class Library {
    private ArrayList<Book> books;		// Library contains Book 
}
```



Inheritance can be a **chain**, for example: `Cat` is a special kind of `DomesticatedAnimal`, and `DomesticatedAnimalis` a special kind of `Animal`. The sub-subclass also inheritances from the super-super class. (`Cat` also inheritances from `Animal`)

```java
public class DomesticatedAnimal extends Animal{		// DomesticatedAnimal is a special kind of Animal
}

public class Cat extends DomesticatedAnimal{		// Cat is a special kind of DomesticatedAnimal
}
```

When there is inheritance between classes, the relationship between them looks like a family tree, sometimes you may hear people use the term "family" like in the previous example, `Animal`, `DomesticatedAnimal` and `Cat` are in a "family". The real technical term for this is `hierarchy`. So we say `Animal`, `DomesticatedAnimal` and `Cat` are in a `hierarchy`.
