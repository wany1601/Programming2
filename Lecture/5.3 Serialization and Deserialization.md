# 5.3 Serialization and Deserialization

Previously we have learned how to use TextIO to read from and write to an external file. Let's see one situation: You have a long list of students (1000 students), the data are originally stored in a txt file or an excel. 

When you want to process the data, you can always use the `readFile()` method that returns an arrayList of Student to read the text file first. However, if you exit the program, the arrayList you have just created will be released, and If you want to re-extract data from the txt file again, you have to re-call `readFile()` to re-generate the arrayList, which may take a while to process.

Also, TextIO allows us to store the data in an external file (text based). But what if we don't really want to always read the file? Like in this example, a programmer does not really need to read the information of students, she/he only need to have the arraylist ready as quick as possible. In this case, TextIO might not be the best choice, and `Serialization` and `Deserialization` might be much better choices. 



## 1. What is Serialization and Deserialization

`Serialization`  is a technology to **store an object into an external file**. The file will be structured based on the object's structure and values. The file is not for programmers to read. The goal of using serialization is to accelerate the speed of loading (creating) an object.

`Deserialization` is the opposite, which **reads the serialized file into a java object**. 



## 2. How to Serialize An Object

Generally there are three steps to serialize an object:

1.  create a `FileOutputStream` object and link it with the file path. You can put this line in the `try-with-resource` structure.

   ```java
   // step 1 create a FileOutputStream object.
   try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path)) {
   } catch (Exception e) {
   }
   ```

   

2. create an `ObjectOutputStream` object and link it with the `FileOutputStream` object.

   ```java
   // step 1 create a FileOutputStream object
   try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path)) {
       // step 2 create an ObjectOutputStream object
       ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
   } catch (Exception e) {
   }
   ```

   

3. use the `writeObject()` to write the object to a file. Since Java will choose the structure to organize the data of the object, there is no need for us to worry about how to write the data to make it look good.

   ```java
   // step 1 create a FileOutputStream object
   try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path)) {
       // step 2 create an ObjectOutputStream object
       ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
       // step 3 call writeObject() to write the object to a file
       oos.writeObject(obj);
   } catch (Exception e) {
   }
   ```

The general method for serialize an object look like:

```java
/**
 * Serializes data into a file
 *
 * @param path the path of the file
 * @param obj the data to be serialized
 */
public static void serializeData(String path, Object obj) {
    // step 1 create a FileOutputStream object
    try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path)) {
        // step 2 create an ObjectOutputStream object
        ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
        // step 3 call writeObject() to write the object to a file
        oos.writeObject(obj);
    } catch (Exception e) {
    }
}
```

Usually we can name the serialized file with extension `.ser`, which won't really affect the data, but just indicate that it is a serialized file.  

And if you try to visualize the `.ser` file, you will find that the data is not readable, which is alright, since the serialized file is not for us to read.

## 3. How to Deserialize An Object

Once we have a serialized file we can desrialize it whenever we want to use it, and Java will directly give you the object without creating the object from scratch.  

Generally there are three steps to serialize an object:

1. create a `FileInputStream` object and link it with the file path. You can put this line in the `try-with-resource` structure.

   ```java
   // step 1 create a FileInputStream object.
   try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(path)) {
   } catch (Exception e) {
   }
   ```

   

2. create an `ObjectOutputStream` object and link it with the `FileOutputStream` object.

   ```java
   // step 1 create a FileInputStream object
   try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(path)) {
       // step 2 create an ObjectInputStream object
       ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);
   } catch (Exception e) {
   }
   ```

   

3. use the `writeObject()` to write the object to a file. Since Java will choose the structure to organize the data of the object, there is no need for us to worry about how to write the data to make it look good.

   ```java
   // step 1 create a FileOutputStream object
   try (FileOutputStream fis = new FileOutputStream(path)) {
       // step 2 create an ObjectInputStream object
       ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);
       // step 3 call readObject() to read the object from a file
       ois.readObject(obj);
   } catch (Exception e) {
   }
   ```

The general method for serialize an object look like:

```java
/**
 * Deserializes a file to data
 *
 * @param path the path of the file
 * @return the deserialized object
 */
public static Object deserializeData(String path) {
    Object obj = null;
    // step 1 create a FileInputStream object
    try ( FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(path)) {
        // step 2 create an ObjectInputStream object
        ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);
        // step 3 call readObject() to read the object from a file
        obj = ois.readObject();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e.getClass() + ": " + e.getMessage());
    }
    return obj;
}
```

Keep in mind that the `deserializeData()` returns an `Object` object, which might not be the class you want. For example, if you have serialized a `Cat cat` object into a file, and then deserialize the file, instead of getting a `Cat cat`, you will have `Object object`. In this case, you cannot use any method defined in the `Cat` class through the deserialized result. **You should always manually cast the deserialized result into the data type that you want. **

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // String[] strs = {"hello", "world", "yi", "wang"};       // original array object
    String path = "stu.ser"; 							// path of the serialized file

    // deserialization always only return an Object object, which usually is
    // not the data type we are looking for. We usually have to cast the result
    // of deserialization into the proper data type manually.
    
    // deserializedData(path) returns Object object, which if you directly print will show you the referece, if you want to visualize the data, you should cast it to String[] then use the Arrays.toString() method
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString((String[]) deserializeData(path)));
}
```



## 4. Serialize and Deserialize Object of A User-defined Class

We have so far seen how to serialize and deserialize object of type `String` and `String[]`, which are both pre-defined in Java. `String[]` is a combination of `Array` and `String`, both of which are pre-defined in Java.

In Java, all pre-defined data-types are `Serializable`, which means you can directly serialize and deserialize them . The same as `ArrayList<String> `, `LinkedList<Integer>`. However, in the example we have at the very beginning, we have a list of students in the file, if we want to serialize them into a file, we should first create an  `ArrayList<Student>` object. This time, the data type of the object we want to serialize and deserialize is a combination of `ArrayList` and `Student`. `ArrayList` is pre-defined in Java, but `Student` is a user-defined class. In Java, all user-defined classes are not `Serializable` be default, which means you cannot directly serialize and deserialize them. If `Student` is not `Serializable`, then `ArrayList<Student>` will also be not `Serializable`. To fix this problem, user have to add `implements Serializable` when defining the class.

```java
// add implements Serializable will make this class Serializable
public class Student implements Serializable {		
    
}
```
