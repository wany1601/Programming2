# 2.2 Polymorphism

## 1. First glance at polymorphism

You might have realized that in the previous example (`Animal`, `DomesitcatedAnimal` and `Dog`) copy constructor in the `Dog` class calls the copy constructor in the `Animal` class . The `Animal` class copy constructor takes one parameter `Animal animal`, but when we were calling the method, we passed `Dog dog` to it. That looks wrong since the data type does not match. However, Java did not complain about it, there was no error when we execute the code. This is called `polymorphism`. You can understand it like this: The Animal class copy constructor requires a parameter of `Animal`, and since the `Dog` class extends the `Animal` class, which means `Dog` is a special kind of `Animal`. In this case, passing a dog is passing a special kind of animal to the method, the two data types match.

In general, **if a method requires a parameter of class B, when you call the method you can pass an object of class B, or you can also pass an object of any subclass of class B.**
