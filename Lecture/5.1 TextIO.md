# 5.1 TextIO

## 1. What Is TextIO

If a programmer want to communicate with computer, she/he can use console. However, if you want to send data to your colleague who is not a programmer, she/he may send you data in excel or a text file, in this case, you need read data from the file, then process the data, and in the end write it to another excel file or a text file. To read and write data from external text files is called Java `TextIO`, where: 

* `I` stands for input: reading data from an external file to Java
* `O` stands for output: writing data from Java to an external file 

## 2. TextIO VS ConsoleIO

In Programming 1 we have learned how to read and write data through the console:

```java
// output: 
	System.out.print(); 
    System.out.println();
    System.out.printf();

//input: 
    Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);

	String str = console.next(); 
	String str2 = nextLine(); 
	int num = nextInt(); 
	double num2 = nextDouble();
```

Console IO is reading and writing through the console, and TextIO is reading and writing through an external file. Even though the source and the destination are different, the methods are shared. We also have to use `print()`, `println()` and `printf()` to output, and `next()`, `nextLine()`, `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()` to input.



## 3 Absolute Path VS Relative Path

Before we learn how to implement TextIO, we first need to know how to represent a path of a file. There are two ways to represent the path of a file: 

* `Absolute Path`: is a path starts from the `root of the Operating System (OS)`. `C:\Users\andre\Desktop\Programming2\Lecture\imgs\Chapter4\ExceptionHierarchy.png`, the absolute path does not care about the address of the describer.

  *  Pro: everyone can find the file with the absolute path, in the other word, the address is never ambiguous. 
  *  Con: if the path of the file changed, it is impossible to find the file.

* `Relative Path`: is a path starts from the path of the current file (describer)  

  `imgs\Chapter4\ExceptionHierarchy.png`, the relative path does care about the address of the describer.
  
  * Pro:  if the path of the file changed, it is possible to find the file (if the relationship between the current file and the target file does not change). 
  * Con: except the current, no file can find the file with the relative path, in the other word, the address is ambiguous. 

In computer science, relative path is frequently used. For example, if you want to develop a website, you may develop it on your local computer, which could be a Windows system machine, then once it is done, you have to transfer the code to a server to host the website, which usually uses Linux system. If you use absolute path in your code, then the server for sure cannot understand the path in your code. However, if the relative relationship between your files in the project remain the same, relative path between files will not be changed, and the Linux system can recognize them.
