# 2.6 Comparable and Comparator

## 1. Sorting Collection of  Java-defined Class Data

When we have a collection of Java-defined Class data, for example an `ArrayList<Integer>`, we might want to sort the data with a specific order (ascending or descending). When we want to sort something, we first have to `define the rule to compare two object` and tell which one is bigger and which one is smaller. Then for ascending sorting, we put the smaller one before the bigger one, and for the descending sorting, we put the bigger one before the smaller one. 

We can use the `Collections.sort()` method to sort the collection ascendingly. And if we want the data to be sorted descendingly, we can use the `Collections.reverse()` method after.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(new Integer[]{1, 3, 4, 2}));

// sort the data ascendingly
Collections.sort(nums);			// 1, 2, 3, 4		

// revere the order of the data
Collections.reverse();			// 4, 3, 2, 1
```



You can also use these methods to sort Strings, then the strings will be alphabetically sorted (also can be ascendingly and descendingly).



## 2. Sorting Collection of User-defined Class Objects

Previously we have seen how to sort an arrayList of Integer or an ArrayList of String, Java can easily handle them with no problem, this is because the rules to sort numbers and strings are clear. However, let's say if we have `ArrayList<Student>  students`, and each student has its `id`, `fname`, `lname`, `age` and `gender`, then Java may get confused cause it does not know how to sort the data, should the sorting based on `fname`, or the `age`, or the `gender`? We cannot expect Java can figure out the rule by itself. In this case, we say by default, the User-defined Class is not `Comparable` 

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {       // implement the interface

    private String id;
    private String fname;
    private String lname;
    private int age;
    private char gender;

    // methods of the class 
}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
    students.add(new Student("1", "yi", "wang", 36, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("2", "mike", "conna", 18, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("3", "jon", "a", 22, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("4", "jon", "c", 22, 'f'));
    students.add(new Student("5", "jon", "b", 22, 'f'));
    students.add(new Student("6", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("-1", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));
}
```

There are two ways to fix this problem:

1. If you want to sort the data with `ONE specific rule`, then use `Comparable`, for example the data is always sorted based on the `name`. 
2. If you want to sort the data with `MORE THAN ONE rules`, then use `Comparator`, for example the data can sometimes be sorted based on the `name`, and sometimes based on the `age`, and sometimes by the `gender`.



## 3. Comparable

If we just want to provide `ONE` rule to compare two students to determine which is bigger and which is smaller, we can use the `Compareble` interface. This interface contains an abstract method `compareTo()`, which is used to define the rule to compare two objects. 

Simply let the `Student` class implements `Comparable`, and then override the `compareTo()` method in the class.

`CompareTo()` behaves very similar to `equals()`, it compares two students, and return an `int`. The absolute value of the `int` number does not matter, only the symbol of it is important. For example, it is the same if the method returns 4 or 999, cause both of them are positive values. but it is different if the method returns 5 or -1, cause one is positive and one is negative. You can simply understand it as the method will do a subtraction of the two object, and if the first object is bigger, then the result is positive, while if the first object is smaller, then the result is negative. 

If we want to compare two students based on their ages, the two students can be represent by `this.age` and `student.age`. Then we need to check what's the data type of the age, we define `int age` at first, so here we need to compare two int numbers which one is bigger, we can simply do a subtraction (`return this.age - student.age;`). With this method we say, well, here we can compare two students who is bigger and who is smaller, then Java can sort the collections.    

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> { 
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student student) {
        return this.age - student.age;              // sort based on the age, ascending
//        return student.age - this.age;              // sort based on the age, descending
    }
}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
    students.add(new Student("1", "yi", "wang", 36, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("2", "mike", "conna", 18, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("3", "jon", "a", 22, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("4", "jon", "c", 22, 'f'));
    students.add(new Student("5", "jon", "b", 22, 'f'));
    students.add(new Student("6", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("-1", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));
    
    Collections.sort(students);
}
```


You can also change the rule, for example, if you want to sort the students based on its `fname`, then you have to modify the `compareTo()` method:

Here we can extract the two `fnama`s with `this.fname` and `student.fname`, however, these two values are Strings, and we cannot use `-` to subtract one string from another. Don't worry, we say all Java-defined Classes are `compareble` by default, that's why we can sort them directly at first. In fact, the `String` class, the `Integer` class, `Double` class are all `comparable`, which contains the `comapreTo()` method inside that we can directly use to compare two Strings, two Integers, and two Doubles. So here we can directly use the `compareTo()` method in the `String` class to compare the two strings.

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> { 
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student student) {
        return this.fname.compareTo(student.fname);   // sort based on the fname, ascending
    }
}
```


The data we have contains students with the same `fname`s :


```java
students.add(new Student("1", "yi", "wang", 36, 'm'));
students.add(new Student("2", "mike", "conna", 18, 'm'));
students.add(new Student("3", "jon", "a", 22, 'm'));			// same fname
students.add(new Student("4", "jon", "c", 22, 'f'));			// same fname
students.add(new Student("5", "jon", "b", 22, 'f'));			// same fname
students.add(new Student("6", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));			// same fname
students.add(new Student("-1", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));			// same fname
```

It is very common when we have a long list of data, for one feature, some elements have the same values, and if just use the previous method to sort them, all these four elements will be considered as the same (`this.fname.compareTo(student.fname)` equals `0` ),  and then Java will not sort these four elements. However, we can see that the `lname` for the four elements are different (`a`, `c`, `b`, `d`), we might want to sort the data based on `lname` if the `fname`s are the same. In this case we might want to expand the rule of the `compareTo()  `  method. 

Notice: we say we will only compare the `lname`s if the `fname`s are the same, so `fname` is more important than `lname`. We can multiply a huge weight of the `fname` part and then add it with the `lname`: `heavy_weight * fname_difference + lname_difference`;

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> { 
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student student) {
        return this.fname.compareTo(student.fname) * 100   // sort based on the fname ascending
            	+ this.lname.compareTo(student.lname) ;   // then lname ascending
    }
}
```

This could be expended to say if the `fname`s are equal and the `lname`s are equal, then we will compare the `id`. You can customize the rule as whatever you want. 

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> { 
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student student) {
        return this.fname.compareTo(student.fname) * 10000	    	 // sort based on the fname ascending
            	+ this.lname.compareTo(student.lname) * 100;    	 // then lname ascending
                 + this.id.compareTo(student.id) ;    				// then id ascending
    }
}
```



## Comparator

`Comparable` can be used can be used if you only want to provide `one specific rule` to sort the data. But for many situations, we need more than one rule to sort the data. For example, a teacher wants to sometimes sort the students based on their names, and then sometimes based on their scores for one specific assignment. Or for an online-shopping website, a customer may want to sometimes sort the products based on the added date, and sometimes sort the products based on the price. 

If we use the `Comparable`, then we can only provide one way to sort the data, and users cannot change the sorting rules. In this case we should use the `Comparator` interface.

We can customize a comparator by defining an additional class that implements the `Comparator` interface, and you can create as many comparator as you want. (Not directly modifying the original class, e.g. `Student`)

We can create a new class which will be used to compare two students based on their ages, so the name of the class can be `AgeComparator`, and that class should implement `Comparator`. The `Comparator` interface also contains an abstract method `compare()`, which is very similar to the `compareTo()` method in the `Comparable` interface. The only difference is you have to pass both two objects to the method as parameters.

```java
/**
 * A Comparator to compare two students based on their ages, then fname, then lname
 */public static class AgeComparator implements Comparator<Student> {

     @Override
     public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
         return (s1.age - s2.age) * 10000
             + s1.fname.compareTo(s2.fname)
             + s1.lname.compareTo(s2.lname);
     }

 }
```

```java
/**
 * A Comparator to compare two students based on their gender, then fname,
 * then lname, then id
 */
public static class GenderComparator implements Comparator<Student> {

    @Override
    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
        return (s1.gender - s2.gender) * 1000000
            + s1.fname.compareTo(s2.fname) * 10000
            + s1.lname.compareTo(s2.lname) * 100
            + s1.id.compareTo(s2.id);
    }

}
```



Now we have three additional classes, each class is a comparator with a specific rule to sort the data. We can use the `Collections.sort()` methods to sort the data again, `with the object of a specific comparator as the second parameter`.

```java
/**
 * Asks the user to choose a specific way to sort the students
 *
 * @param students the original students list
 */
public static void sortStudents(ArrayList<Student> students) {
    System.out.println("How do you want to sort the students");
    System.out.println("1. based on the age");
    System.out.println("2. based on the name");
    System.out.println("3. based on the gender");

    Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
    int choice = console.nextInt();

    switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            Collections.sort(students, new Student.AgeComparator());		// sort based on age
            return;
        case 2:
            Collections.sort(students, new Student.NameComparator());		// sort based on name
            return;
        case 3:
            Collections.sort(students, new Student.GenderComparator());		// sort based on gender
            return;
    }
}
```
